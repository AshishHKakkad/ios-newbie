Small projects created on my way to iOS nirvana

The files are public domain - unless there is a different note (by their respective authors) on the top of some files.

To compile some of the projects you need to install CocoaPods:

        sudo gem update --system
        sudo gem install cocoapods
        pod setup

and then run in the project dir:

        pod install
